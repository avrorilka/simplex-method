# Simplex Method

Special methods and theories have been developed and are being developed to solve mathematical programming problems.
Since a significant amount of calculations have to be performed when solving these tasks,
efficiency and ease of implementation on a computer are of great importance in the comparative evaluation of methods.

## Project Preview

<p>After opening the software product, the user sees two numeric fields in front of him, with the help of which he can dynamically
change the number of variables and restrictions.</p>
<p>After that, you need to enter the free coefficients of the function and determine whether it is a maximization or minimization problem
using the drop-down menu. According to a similar principle, it is necessary to fill in the coefficients of restrictions and determine
the sign of equality or inequality. By default, all fields (except the number of variables and constraints) are zero,
this simplifies the task for the user. Data validation is also present on all fields to prevent errors.</p>
